## Technical & Design • Achievements  

The data which was used, had to be normalized throughout because it was not clean data. The CSV combined two different separate data types 


## Future Enhancements  

Previously I had never implemented any form of animation in my data visualizations. I was able to utilize d3 animations to transition
