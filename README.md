## Description 

The goal of this User Interface was to display relevant universities in the state of Massuchusetts. The main components impleneted here were Fuzzy Search based on Institutional Names, Dynamic Pagination, as well as a detailed information about each university and their programs. No external libraries were used. This application allows users to view a more detailed view of the university if they click on Programs. If they click on Visit that will take them to the univerisity's external site.

Special thanks to ReactJS, US Department of Education, HTML, CSS, and Git Pages
